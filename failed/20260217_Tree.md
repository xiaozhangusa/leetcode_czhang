# ASCII Christmas Tree Generator

This document explains the logic and implementation for generating a tree-shaped ASCII art centered around its middle column, based on a growth parameter `L`.

## Problem Description
The goal is to generate a tree that grows in "tiers" with an odd-star growth pattern (1, 3, 5...).

### Growth Pattern
- **L = 1**: 1 tier of height 2 (Stars: 1, 3).
- **L = 2**: Tier 1 (H=2, Stars: 1, 3), Tier 2 (H=3, Stars: 1, 3, 5).
- **L = 3**: Tier 1 (H=2, Stars: 1, 3), Tier 2 (H=3, Stars: 1, 3, 5), Tier 3 (H=4, Stars: 1, 3, 5, 7).

## Logic Breakdown

### 1. Tier Heights
The height of each tier `i` (1 to `L`) is calculated as:
- `H_i = i + 1`

### 2. Star Counts
Within each tier `i`, the number of stars in row `j` is:
- `Stars = 2j - 1`

### 3. Centering and Width
- **Width**: The maximum number of stars in the final tier.
- **Middle Column** (`mid`): `width // 2`.
- **Left Padding**: `mid - (stars // 2)`.

## Implementation

```python
def build_tree(L):
    """
    Builds a tree-shaped ASCII art centered around its middle column.
    
    Growth Pattern Logic:
    1. Tiers: The tree is divided into L vertical sections (tiers).
    2. Height: Each tier 'i' has a height of i + 1.
    3. Stars: Within each tier, row 'j' has 2j - 1 stars (1, 3, 5...).
    """
    if L < 1: return ""

    # Calculate structure and max width
    tiers = []
    max_stars = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        height = i + 1
        tier_rows = []
        for j in range(1, height + 1):
            stars = 2 * j - 1
            tier_rows.append(stars)
            if stars > max_stars:
                max_stars = stars
        tiers.append(tier_rows)

    width = max_stars
    mid = width // 2
    output = []

    # Build the star rows
    for tier in tiers:
        for stars in tier:
            left_padding = mid - (stars // 2)
            output.append(" " * left_padding + "*" * stars)
        output.append("") # Spacer between tiers

    if output and output[-1] == "": output.pop()

    # Trunk and Base
    output.append(" " * mid + "|")
    output.append("—" * mid + "+" + "—" * mid)
    return "\n".join(output)
```

### Detailed Logic Explanation
The core logic block for calculating the tree's structure is explained below:

```python
# tracker to find the widest row of the whole tree
max_stars = 0

# iterate through each "tier" (section) from 1 to L
for i in range(1, L + 1):
    
    # tier height: Tier 1 is 2 rows, Tier 2 is 3 rows, etc.
    height = i + 1
    
    # store star counts for JUST this tier
    tier_rows = []
    
    # iterate through each row within this specific tier
    for j in range(1, height + 1):
        
        # Odd Number formula: 2j - 1
        stars = 2 * j - 1
        
        tier_rows.append(stars)
        
        # update trackers
        if stars > max_stars:
            max_stars = stars
            
    # add the tier data to the master list
    tiers.append(tier_rows)
```

This logic builds a data map of the tree (e.g., `[[1, 3], [1, 3, 5]]` for `L=2`) before any printing occurs, ensuring the layout is perfectly balanced.
