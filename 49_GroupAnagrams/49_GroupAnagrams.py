# Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

# Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

# Explanation:

# There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
# The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
# The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
# Example 2:

# Input: strs = [""]

# Output: [[""]]

# Example 3:

# Input: strs = ["a"]

# Output: [["a"]]

 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= strs.length <= 104
# 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
# strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        # create a dictionary to store the anagrams and this dictionary has good feature that it doesn't need to check if the key exists
        ans = defaultdict(list)
        
        # loop through the strings
        for s in strs:
            cnt = [0] * 26
            for c in s:
                cnt[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
            ans[tuple(cnt)].append(s)
        return list(ans.values())
