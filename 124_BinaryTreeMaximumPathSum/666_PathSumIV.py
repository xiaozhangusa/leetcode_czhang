# If the depth of a tree is smaller than 5, then this tree can be represented by an array of three-digit integers. You are given an ascending array nums consisting of three-digit integers representing a binary tree with a depth smaller than 5, where for each integer:

# The hundreds digit represents the depth d of this node, where 1 <= d <= 4.
# The tens digit represents the position p of this node within its level, where 1 <= p <= 8, corresponding to its position in a full binary tree.
# The units digit represents the value v of this node, where 0 <= v <= 9.
# Return the sum of all paths from the root towards the leaves.

# It is guaranteed that the given array represents a valid connected binary tree.

 

# Example 1:



# Input: nums = [113,215,221]

# Output: 12

# Explanation:

# The tree that the list represents is shown.
# The path sum is (3 + 5) + (3 + 1) = 12.

# Example 2:



# Input: nums = [113,221]

# Output: 4

# Explanation:

# The tree that the list represents is shown. 
# The path sum is (3 + 1) = 4.

 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 15
# 110 <= nums[i] <= 489
# nums represents a valid binary tree with depth less than 5.
# nums is sorted in ascending order.
